Description:
Health impact assessment of the potential mortality and morbitidy benefits
of shutting down two coal-fired powerplants in the Front Range region of 
Colorado

Project is sponsored by the American Lung Association

The methods used in this analysis were based on those for the study done by Jacob Pratt, Ryan Gan, and others here at CSU. In this original study, they estimated the impacts of wildfire-smoke related ozone for the entire United States. Because we had a smaller study area, we were able to include more sources of uncertainty.

The scripts are numbered for the order in which they should be run.
